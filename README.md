# Don't Eject The Impostor

Our implementations are based on the MPC framework MOTION ([ePrint](https://ia.cr/2020/1137), [GitHub](https://github.com/encryptogroup/MOTION)), this repository is a fork of MOTION.

This code is provided as an experimental implementation for testing purposes and should not be used in a productive environment. We cannot guarantee security and correctness.

We provide supplementary material in [this file](supplementary_material.pdf), which includes all additionally required gates, such as truncation and ReLU, for machine learning operations, ensuring completeness.

## Requirements

* A **Linux distribution** of your choice (MOTION was developed and tested with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) and [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), we worked with Manjaro and Arch Linux on x86_64 architecture).
* **Required packages for MOTION:**
  * `g++` (version >=10)
    or another compiler and standard library implementing C++20 including the filesystem library
  * `make`
  * `cmake`
  * [`boost`](https://www.boost.org/) (version >=1.75.0)
  * `OpenMP`
  * [`OpenSSL`](https://www.openssl.org/) (version >=1.1.0)
* **Don't Eject The Impostor** tested on:
  * `g++` 13.1.1
  * `make` 4.4.1
  * `cmake` 3.27.0
  * [`boost`](https://www.boost.org/) 1.81.0
  * `OpenMP` 15.0.7
  * [`OpenSSL`](https://www.openssl.org/) 3.1.1

## Building MOTION

1. Clone this repository and enter its directory

2. Create and enter the build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`

3. Use CMake configure the build:
    ```
    cmake .. -DMOTION_BUILD_EXE=On -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```
    This also initializes and updates the Git submodules of the dependencies
    located in `extern/`. If one of the dependencies is already installed at a standard location, CMake will try to use the installed version.
    **If building one of the automatically installed submodules leads to problems (which may happen for g++ versions deviating from what we tested on (13.1.1)), please manually install an up-to-date version on your system.**

4. Call `make` in the build directory.
   Optionally, add `-j $number_of_parallel_jobs` to `make` for faster compilation.
   You can find the build executables and libraries in the directories `bin/`
   and `lib/`, respectively.

## Running the Protocols

Our protocol implementations can be found in `src/motioncore/protocols/`. ASTRA and AUXILIATOR are both bundled in the ASTRA files while SWIFT and SOCIUM are bundled in the SOCIUM files.
Benchmarks for ML inference on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets can be started as follows (for each party):
```
bin/[PROTOCOL]_benchmark --repetitions=[REPETITIONS] --cnn [CNN] --my-id [ID] --parties 0,[IP0],[PORT0] 1,[IP1],[PORT1] 2,[IP2],[PORT2]
```
with arguments:
* PROTOCOL: `astra`, `auxiliator`, `socium`, or `swift`
* REPETITIONS: Number of repetitions, e.g., `1`
* CNN: `mnist` or `cifar10`
* ID: `0`, `1`, or `2` depending on which party you wish to start
* IP0, IP1, IP2: IPv4 address of the respective party
* PORT0, PORT1, PORT2: Communication port of the respective party

**Example for running AUXILIATOR on local machine for MNIST:**
```
bin/auxiliator_benchmark --repetitions=1 --cnn mnist --my-id 0 --parties 0,127.0.0.1,23000 1,127.0.0.1,23001 2,127.0.0.1,23002 &
bin/auxiliator_benchmark --repetitions=1 --cnn mnist --my-id 1 --parties 0,127.0.0.1,23000 1,127.0.0.1,23001 2,127.0.0.1,23002 &
bin/auxiliator_benchmark --repetitions=1 --cnn mnist --my-id 2 --parties 0,127.0.0.1,23000 1,127.0.0.1,23001 2,127.0.0.1,23002
```

The benchmarking outputs are written into files `[PROTOCOLNAME]_Benchmark_[CNN]_P[ID].txt` in the `build` directory.
For a simple aggregation of these outputs among all parties, run
```
python3 ../benchmarkparser.py [CNN] [PROTOCOL]
```
from the `build` directory for `CNN` `mnist` or `cifar10` and protocol `Astra`, `Auxiliator`, `Socium`, or `Swift`.
For the previous example:
```
python3 ../benchmarkparser.py mnist Auxiliator
```
